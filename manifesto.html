<p>A free and pluralistic press is crucial for the intellectual and political livelihood of the individual. But media freedom, pluralism and independent journalism across Azeroth face threats from economic influence, military pressures and the ever-changing private and public geopolitical landscape.</p>

<p>Founded in response, the Azeroth Free Press fights for the liberties of the media. Championing truthfulness, accuracy, objectivity, impartiality, and accountability in the acquisition and publication of newsworthy information.</p>

<center><p>It is our promise to uphold and vanguard these tenets in the interests of our readership and the diverse peoples of Azeroth.</p></center>
