<p>A free and pluralistic press is crucial for the intellectual and political livelihood of the individual. But media freedom, pluralism and independent journalism across Azeroth face threats from economic influence, military pressures and the ever-changing private and public geopolitical landscape.</p>

<p>It is in response to this threat that the Azeroth Free Press was founded. Championing truthfulness, accuracy and objectivity; impartiality, fairness, and public accountability in both the acquisition of newsworthy information and its subsequent dissemination to the public.</p>

<center><p>It is our promise to uphold and vanguard these tenets in the interests of our readership and, more broadly, the people of Azeroth.</p></center>
